## Hi there 👋

I'm going to build a machine learning platform from zero to one, with golang && k8s.

Here is the [design doc](https://easyai-io.github.io/docs/#/design/easyai_platform) for easyai platform.

The Project includes backend-server、web-portal and cli-tool，since I'm not a professional frontend developer, the progress of web portal development might be very slow.
